						<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">OUR HISTORY</h3>


						<p>The history of ecommerce started 40 years ago and, to this day, continues to grow with new technologies, innovations, and thousands of businesses entering the online market each year. Electronic Data Interchanges and teleshopping in the 1970s paved the way for the modern day ecommerce store. The history of ecommerce is closely intertwined with the history of the internet. Online shopping only became possible when the internet was opened to the public in 1991.</p>

						<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">MOBILE-O-MANIA TIMELINE</h3>
						<h3><u>1960s - 1990s: The Early Days of eCommerce</u></h3>
						<p>eCommerce started in the 1960s, when technological developments meant that data could be exchanged electronically for the first time, but fast forward to the 1990s, and this was the decade that online retailing really began to take off.</p>

						<h3><u>Early 2000s: Introducing Broadband</u></h3>
						<p>the introduction of broadband to people’s homes didn’t only mean that more people were buying online, it also meant that people were starting to conduct more research before placing an order. With easy access to the internet increasing, the average time spent researching products and searching for more competitive prices also increased.</p>

						<h3><u>2010s: The Rise of Mobile Commerce</u></h3>
						<p>With the increase in smartphone owners over the years, mobile devices have caused a shift in the way eCommerce now operates.Our Company was founded in 2010, spurred by what Velos called his 'Initiating Framework', which describes his efforts as an initiate to participate in the Internet Business. We received a funding of $12 million from Venture Partners and Indo-US Venture Partners. </p>
